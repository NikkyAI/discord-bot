## twitch notifications

the bot will not automatically get webhook management permissions because the usual setup for notification channels is to disallow `@everyone` from everything but seeing the channel
so you will need to add a override for the bot role (`Yuno`) anyways

to check if the permission setup is correct run  
`/twitch check`  
it will tell you the missing permissions

### add a twitch notification

`/twitch add role:@notifyme twitch:username`  
optionally you can pass `channe:#channel`, by default it uses the current channel

## role selection

to check if the permission setup is correct run  
`/role check`  
it will tell you the missing permissions

make sure that the bot role (`Yuno`) is above all of the roles that you want ot make selectable
(discord will not let the bot assign roles that are above itself in the list)

### add a role chooser

`/role add section:something reaction:‚ù§ role:@role`  
optionally you can pass `channe:#channel`, by default it uses the current channel  

you can add multiple roles to the same section, they will be added to the same message
